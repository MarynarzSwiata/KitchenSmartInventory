# Test Spell Checker

This is a test file to check if the spell checker is working properly.

Here are some deliberately misspelled words:
- correctt (should be "correct")
- spellchekcer (should be "spell checker") 
- worng (should be "wrong")
- languege (should be "language")

And some Polish words:
- język (correct Polish word)
- błędny (correct Polish word)
- niepoprawny (correct Polish word)

Technical terms that should be recognized:
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- Pydantic
- KitchenSmartInventory
- CRUD operations
- UUID identifiers

If you see red underlines under the misspelled words, the spell checker is working correctly!
